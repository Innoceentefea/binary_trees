Binary trees are a type of hierarchical data structure in computer science, consisting of nodes connected in a tree-like fashion. Each node in a binary tree can have at most two child nodes, known as the left child and the right child. The structure resembles a tree with branches growing downward, where each node represents a specific element or data point.

Here are the key concepts and characteristics of binary trees:

1. Node: A node is a fundamental building block of a binary tree. It contains data or a value and can have references or pointers to its left and right child nodes.

2. Root Node: The root node is the topmost node of a binary tree. It serves as the starting point for traversing or accessing other nodes in the tree.

3. Child Nodes: Each node in a binary tree can have at most two child nodes, namely the left child and the right child. These child nodes are connected to the parent node.

4. Parent Node: A node in a binary tree that has child nodes is called a parent node. It is the immediate ancestor of its child nodes.

5. Leaf Node: A leaf node, also known as a terminal node or external node, is a node that does not have any child nodes. It is located at the bottom of the binary tree.

6. Internal Node: An internal node is a node that has at least one child node. It is any node in the binary tree that is not a leaf node.

7. Binary Search Tree (BST): A binary search tree is a specific type of binary tree that follows a particular ordering property. In a binary search tree, the value of each node in the left subtree is less than the value of the node itself, while the value of each node in the right subtree is greater than the value of the node.

8. Traversing a Binary Tree: Traversing a binary tree involves visiting each node in a specific order. Common traversal methods include in-order traversal (left child, parent, right child), pre-order traversal (parent, left child, right child), and post-order traversal (left child, right child, parent).

Binary trees have various applications in computer science and programming, including:

1. Searching and Retrieving Data: Binary search trees provide an efficient way to search for specific values in a sorted collection of data. The ordering property of a binary search tree allows for faster retrieval by eliminating half of the remaining search space at each step.

2. Sorting: Binary trees can be used to implement sorting algorithms such as heapsort or binary tree sort.

3. Expression Evaluation: Binary trees can represent mathematical expressions, where each node represents an operator or operand. Evaluation of the expression can be done by traversing the tree and performing the corresponding operations.

4. File Systems: Many file systems, such as hierarchical file systems, use binary tree-like structures to organize and navigate through directory structures.

5. Huffman Coding: Binary trees are used in data compression algorithms such as Huffman coding, where the frequencies of characters are represented by a binary tree to achieve optimal encoding.

Binary trees provide a flexible and efficient way to organize and represent hierarchical data structures. Their properties and operations make them useful in a wide range of applications in computer science and programming.
